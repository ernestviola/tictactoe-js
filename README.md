# Tic Tac Toe
A tic tac toe clone made with primarily javscript. This project will be used
in order to solidify understanding of factory function and the module pattern.
We'll be using closures and private variables in order to complete the project

## Lessons Learned
Separation of concerns. By separating the game logic and the UI we can easily
make changes to any code without being worried about breaking things.

Pseudo code is important. Spend a bit more time thinking about how objects will
be accessed and used.

Factory functions: don't use the this keyword. That's used for within the same
scope.
